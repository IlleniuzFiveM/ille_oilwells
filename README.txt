Hello, thank you for downloading ille_oilwells V1

• Here is my discord for more fivem scripts:
https://discord.gg/SJgAWHwQbn

• If you want to give a player an oilwell:

/giveoilwell [PlayerID] [oilwellName]

• The oilwellName can be found in the sql, the default oilwell names are:
- oilwell1
- oilwell2
- oilwell3
- oilwell4

All of the coordinates for every oilwell are in the config.lua file.

• If you want to delete a player's oilwell:

/deloilwell [PlayerID] [oilwellName]

It's same like the give command.

The oilwell generates 500$ every 5 minutes, you change that in the config.lua
